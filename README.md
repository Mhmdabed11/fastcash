# fastcash

Fastcash is a web applicaiton which allow users to post and find jobs online worldwide.
The app is still in its ***early stages and under development***, so you will find bugs and inconsistencies.
The technologies used for this project are:
 - `Nextjs` as a React framework for SSR
 - `Apollo client` as a graphql client
 - `bulma css` for styling
 
 You can access the web app [here](http://15.188.8.145:3000/).
 To make it simple, I have created a test user for you to test the web app at its current state. More features and enhancements are along the way.

 - Sample password: ***test***
